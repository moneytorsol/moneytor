# üëÅÔ∏è Moneytor

An advanced real-time monitoring tool for pump-fun tokens, designed to help traders focus on the top-performing coins. In the future, we'll offer websocket access for developers to customize their experience.

## üåü Key Features

### X.com Account Watcher

-   Track multiple accounts effortlessly with a customizable watchlist.
-   Set time limits to narrow down the best opportunities.
-   Receive real-time notifications for high-potential tickers as soon as they launch.
-   Experience low-latency tracking for rapid insights.
-   Developers can connect to the main websocket and integrate their own logic for enhanced automation.

## üõ°Ô∏è Roadmap

-  Send alerts to Discord and Slack when a ticker meets your defined conditions.
-  Configure the cloud version across multiple regions for better performance and scalability.
-  Contribute to and customize the project by accessing the open-source code.
-  Learn how to build the project locally and integrate with multiple APIs with our step-by-step video guide.
-  Expand support beyond "pump"-ending contract addresses to include all pump.fun tokens.
-  Replace AWS's SNS x SQS stack with Google Cloud Pub/Sub for more robust messaging.
-  Offer a fully managed Moneytor (utilizing the cloud) for traders that are allergic to dev tasks.
